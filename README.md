# Blazor Workflow Builder

This project is a visual workflow builder built with [Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and powered by the [Blazor.Diagrams](https://github.com/Blazor-Diagrams/Blazor.Diagrams) library.

Users can drag nodes (such as Start, If/Else, Switch, End, etc.) onto the canvas and visually connect them. Each node can be clicked to open a right-side drawer to configure node-specific details like title, subtitle, or other data.
